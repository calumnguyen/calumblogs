# Simplifying QSR Operations Through Technology

I'm a technology enthusiast focused on streamlining Quick Service Restaurant operations through innovative digital solutions.

Since encountering McDonald's innovative fingerprint authentication system in 2015, I have dedicated my career to advancing technological solutions in the Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) industry. My passion lies in developing digital tools and systems that enhance operational efficiency and workforce productivity. Through continuous innovation, I strive to transform traditional QSR processes, creating solutions that streamline operations and reduce inefficiencies across the food service sector.

**You can ask me:**

> Calum, we need to brainstorm a few ideas on how to effectively deliver the training for the new M5 coming up. Can you get us a quick Canvas to collaborate together?
