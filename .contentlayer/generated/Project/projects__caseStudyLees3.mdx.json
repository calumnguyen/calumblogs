Ensuring food safety not only establishes a secure environment for both guests and employees but also serves as a pivotal measure to safeguard Lee's Sandwiches brand and its overall image.\n\n**Our goals for this portion of the presentation**\n\n1. Heighten the priority of ensuring all stores are compliant with FSA regulations.\n2. Minimize the potential for foodborne illnesses and mitigate brand liability.\n\n**Observation**\n\nWhile Lee's Sandwiches has a QSI in place to outline prepping and cooking procedures aimed at ensuring food safety, several food safety issues persist within each store.\n\nInstances such as unmarked buckets of boba and failure to monitor temperatures or utilize timers for fried products have been observed at various locations. These situations pose significant risks, including:\n\n- Public health hazards and potential foodborne illnesses\n- Financial losses stemming from Health Department closures, lawsuits, fees and fines, as well as re-training expenses\n- Diminished brand reputation and image\n- Products falling below established standards\n- Dissatisfied customers\n\n**Food Safety Assessment**\n\nFood Safety Assessment is an audit of company's standards of food safety across all locations each quarter.\n\nThe audit could be done through in-house representatives or third-party vendor such as Steritech.\n\nThe final grading should be reflected as:\n\n- **Red -** Unit has failed the FSA audit for the quarter\n- **Yellow -** Unit has passed the FSA audit for the quarter, but there are still critical area of opportunities to work on\n- **Green -** Unit has passed the FSA audit for the quarter, with no critical area of opportunities found\n\nThe audit inspection will be random, and within stores' business hours. For each inspection, a clear report will entails list of opportunities found regarding FSA and points deducted thereof. The report will also include pictures and detailed descriptions of these areas of opportunity. The less points deducted for FSA violations, the better the store is at maintaining a FSA complied store.\n\n**FSA Score Factors**\n\n**Behaviors:**\n\n1. **Handwashing log** is available and completed for the business day. Each hour, each employee must wash their hands and sign the paper to confirm that they have washed their hands. PICs must verify the completion of the handwashing log during their shifts.\n2.
